# videosplit

`videosplit` is a command line application for splitting video files based on timestamps.

It uses `ffmpeg` to perform the actual video splitting / extraction.

## Installation

If you are running Windows, download the latest release and add the binary in to your PATH. Alternatively you can build it yourself via `nimble install` (requires a [Nim installation](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim)).

Make sure you have a recent version of `ffmpeg` installed as well.

## Usage

Use the `help` option in order to discover all possible commands and parameters.

```bash
videosplit --help
```

Output:

```
Usage:
  videosplit [required&optional-params]
Split video based on a set of timestamps passed in via a CSV file
Options:
  -h, --help                           print this cligen-erated help
  --help-syntax                        advanced: prepend,plurals,..
  -f=, --file=       string  REQUIRED  path to input video
  -c=, --csv=        string  REQUIRED  path to CSV containing split instructions
  -o=, --outputDir=  string  REQUIRED  path to directory where videos will be written to
  -v, --verbose      bool    false     show more information
  -s, --script       bool    false     print ffmpeg commands instead of immediate execution
```

### Split using CSV

Split the given video based on a set of timestamps passed in via a CSV

```bash
videosplit \
     -f 'longvideo.webm' \  # video file
     -t 'timestamps.csv' \  # csv with timestamps/names
     -o 'out/'              # directory in which to place the videos
```

Given the following `timestamps.csv`:

```csv
0:00:00.0,Introduction
0:01:30.0,Topic 1
0:11:07.500,Topic 2
```

Executing the command above will result in the following, whereas each file contains the video from its start to the next timestamp (or end of file if no follow-up exists).

```
$ ls out/
$ out/001_Introduction.webm
$ out/002_Topic 1.webm
$ out/003_Topic 2.webm
```

Alternatively you can specify two timestamps in order to explictly cut out individual parts of a video:

```csv
0:01:30.0,0:07:31,Topic 1
```

### Script output

If you want to generate a list of `ffmpeg` commands for further use in scripts you can simply append the `--script` parameter. In this case no actual video splitting will take place.

```bash
videosplit \
     -f 'longvideo.webm' \  # video file
     -t 'timestamps.csv' \  # csv with timestamps/names
     -o 'out/'              # directory in which to place the videos
     --script               # activcate script mode
```

## Alternatives

This application basically just a simple wrapper for `ffmpeg`. You could could alternatively write a shell script to perform the necessary commands yourself.

Example command:
```bash
ffmpeg -i "longvideo.webm" -ss 9:28:52 -y -c copy -t 77 "out\002_Topic 1.webm"
```
